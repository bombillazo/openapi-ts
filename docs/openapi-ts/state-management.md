# State Management

Any reasonably large application will have to deal with state management at some point. State-related code is often one of the biggest boilerplates in your codebase. Well, at least until you start using our state management plugins.

## Options

Hey API natively supports the following state managers.

- [Pinia Colada](/openapi-ts/plugins/pinia-colada)
- [TanStack Query](/openapi-ts/plugins/tanstack-query)
- [SWR](/openapi-ts/plugins/swr) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Zustand](/openapi-ts/plugins/zustand) <span data-soon>Soon</span>

Don't see your state manager? Let us know your interest by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues).
