### Versioning

This package does NOT follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) strategy. Please pin an exact version so you can safely upgrade when you're ready.

Due to the nature of the package, we use the following versioning strategy.

- `1.x.x`: significant breaking changes, reserved for v1 release
- `x.1.x`: breaking changes
- `x.x.1`: new features, bug fixes, and non-breaking changes

We publish [migration notes](/openapi-ts/migrating) for every breaking release. You might not be impacted by a breaking release if you don't use the affected plugin(s).

## Usage

### CLI

Most people run `@hey-api/openapi-ts` via CLI. To do that, add a script to your `package.json` file which will make `openapi-ts` executable through script.

```json
"scripts": {
  "openapi-ts": "openapi-ts"
}
```

The above script can be executed by running `npm run openapi-ts` or equivalent command in other package managers. Next, we will create a [configuration](/openapi-ts/configuration) file and move our options from Quick Start to it.

### Node.js

You can also generate output programmatically by calling `createClient()` in a JavaScript/TypeScript file.

::: code-group

```ts [script.ts]
import { createClient } from '@hey-api/openapi-ts';

createClient({
  input: 'hey-api/backend', // sign up at app.heyapi.dev
  output: 'src/client',
});
```

### Configuration

It's a good practice to extract your configuration into a separate file. Learn how to do that and discover available options on the [Configuration](/openapi-ts/configuration) page.
